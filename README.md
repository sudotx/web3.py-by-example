# web3.py-by-example

Oh, look what we have here - another repo filled with "educational" examples on how to interact with blockchain networks using Python! How exciting!

Important: This repo is for educational purposes only, use at your own risk :)

Anyway, if you're feeling brave (or just really bored), this repository contains some programs written in Python that show you how to query blockchain data, send transactions, and interact with smart contracts using the web3.py library. So go ahead and have some fun, but just remember - you've been warned!

Also, if you happen to spot any errors or want to contribute some examples of your own, pull requests are always welcome! Let's all learn together.
